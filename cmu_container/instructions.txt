1. Build cmu_exploration:latest image locally or pull remotely.

2. Run the following command:
docker run -it --rm \
  --network host \
  -e ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<your_domain_id> \
  cmu_exploration:latest

Replace <your_domain_id> with whichever domain you are using (used for ROS2 communication between container and local machine)
-v flag can be used to bindmount directories containing config files and simulation resources
