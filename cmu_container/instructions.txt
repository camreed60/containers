This container is meant to be a template for using the CMU exploration environments. Feel free to modify to your specific use case.

First: 
chmod +x build.sh run.sh

To build:
./build.sh 
** If downloading environments takes too long comment out in Dockerfile and download manually within container, instructions are as follows:
  cd to /colcon_ws/src/cmu_exploration/src/vehicle_simulator/mesh 
  chmod +x download_environments.sh
  ./download_environments.sh

To run the container:
./run.sh

Remember to source both the container and the host machine using: source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

Test host machine and container connectivity using ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker in one and ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener in the other

Run "newgrp docker" when getting error messages when trying to run ./build.sh
